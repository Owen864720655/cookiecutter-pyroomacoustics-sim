# cookiecutter-pyroomacoustics-sim

A cookie cutter to quickly get started with room acoustics simulation
using [pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics).

This cookie cutter let's you create a basic scenario with one audio source
and two microphones. Whether the simulation is 2D or 3D and the shape of the
room can be configured during the creation.

## Quick start

    # if not done yet, install cookie cutter and pyroomacoustics
    pip install cookiecutter
    pip install pyroomacoustics
    
    # create the new simulation script
